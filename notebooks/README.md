This folder includes some design examples for the FGPU architecture:
* **FGPU_copy.ipynb**: copies some region of a given size within the global memory
* **FGPU_edge_detection.ipynb**: applies a compass edge detection filter on a grayscale image using sobel filters
* **FGPU_median.ipynb**: applies a median filter on an RGB image

The folder *OpenCL_code* contains the code for each kernel.

Needed bitstreams can be found in the *bitstreams* directory.
